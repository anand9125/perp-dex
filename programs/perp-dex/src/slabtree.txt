# slab tree 
A slab stores nodes in a fixed-size array inside an on-chain account.


Benefits:

Fixed memory (so Solana account size is known at init).

Deterministic offsets (works with #[account(zero_copy)]).

Efficient: O(log n) insert/remove (tree path length) and O(1) traversal to next/prev using indices.
